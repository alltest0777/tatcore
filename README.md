# Network

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chain ID | `tat-1` |
| Address Prefix | `tat` |
| Base Denom | `utat` |
| Display Denom | `TAT` |
| Decimals | `6` |
| Consensus | CometBFT |
| SDK | Cosmos SDK v0.53 |

# Project Status

Current status:

- ✅ Public Testnet
- ✅ Validator node
- ✅ State Sync
- ✅ GitHub Releases
- ✅ Automatic CI/CD
- ✅ Linux builds
- ✅ ARM64 builds
- ✅ Documentation in progress

---

# Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alltest0777/tatcore.git
cd tatcore
```

Build and install:

```bash
make install
```

Verify installation:

```bash
tatcoind version
```

You are now ready to initialize a TatCoin node.

---

# Installation

TatCoin requires Go 1.24 or newer.

Install dependencies and build the binary:

```bash
make install
```

The binary will be installed as:

```text
tatcoind
```

Check the installed version:

```bash
tatcoind version
```

---

# Initialize a Node

Create a new node:

```bash
tatcoind init mynode --chain-id tat-1
```

This command creates the local blockchain configuration under:

```text
~/.tatcoind
```

---

# Configure the Network

Download the official network configuration from:

```text
networks/tat-1/
```

This directory contains:

- genesis.json
- genesis.sha256
- peers.txt
- README.md
- STATE_SYNC.md

Copy the genesis file:

```bash
cp networks/tat-1/genesis.json ~/.tatcoind/config/
```

---

# Start the Node

Run:

```bash
tatcoind start
```

If everything is configured correctly, the node will begin synchronizing with the TatCoin Testnet.

---

# Join the Public Testnet

Network parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chain ID | tat-1 |
| Address Prefix | tat |
| Base Denom | utat |
| Display Denom | TAT |

The latest network configuration is always available in:

```text
networks/tat-1/
```

---

# State Sync

TatCoin supports fast synchronization using State Sync.

The complete setup guide is available in:

```text
networks/tat-1/STATE_SYNC.md
```

Using State Sync allows new validators and full nodes to synchronize in minutes instead of downloading the entire blockchain history.

---

# Releases

Every Git tag automatically creates a GitHub Release.

Each release includes:

- Linux AMD64 binary
- Linux ARM64 binary
- SHA256 checksums

Example:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Releases are available at:

```text
https://github.com/alltest0777/tatcore/releases
```
